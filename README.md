I used LLM to quickly summarize information from the website.
The LLM system has an assistant who specializes in potted plants that can be grown at home.
When you enter a URL to a website, the system scrapes it and gives a result with a summary of tips for the novice gardener on how to care and maintain the plant.

For this, I used Llama3.2 to install it according to the steps below:

1. Download and install Ollama from https://ollama.com noting that on a PC you might need to have administrator permissions for the install to work properly
2. On a PC, start a Command prompt / Powershell (Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter).
3. Run ollama run llama3.2 or for smaller machines try ollama run llama3.2:1b

Make sure you have installed all the required libraries (check requirements.txt)
